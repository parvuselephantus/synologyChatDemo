To run these examples you need to have access to Synology Chat. Create a Bot (for two way communication) or incomming webhook (for Java -> Synology only), to run examples you need to configure config/application.properties (see template in config folder) with url and token.

This is a demo on how to call Synology Chat with Java. This project contains:
- some examples (see examples package) on how to call Synology Chat API
- how to receive messages - demo is based on SpringBoot framework:
-- see ChatDemoApplication on main to run the demo
-- see ChatDemoWebsiteController on the controller and all the API that this server demo exposes

This Demo uses external libraries:
- Springboot
- Apache HttpComponents
- Jackson
